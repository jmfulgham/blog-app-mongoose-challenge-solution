Blog app challenge (Node.js) 
==========================
##**Languages/Frameworks used:** 
_Database:_ Mongo 
_Testing:_ Mocha, Chai, Travis  
_Languages:_ JavaScript
_Other Libraries:_ jQuery, Express, Mongoose

###Overview
This exercise was solely focused on integrating testing with my Mongo database. I used seed data to test my CRUD functionality. My testing framework was Mocha, and even though I was using Node.js to build this, I used Chai as my assertion library; Travis has been added as my integration testing platform.
